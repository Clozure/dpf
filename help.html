Instructions
</h2>
<p>
Use the File menu to create a new slideshow window.  You can create as many slideshow windows as you want.
</p>
<p>
Slideshow windows stay on top by default. Use the View menu or Preferences to change that.
</p>
<p>
Preferences affect what happens to new windows. To change a window that already exists use the View menu.
</p>
<p>
Use the arrow keys to move to the next or previous picture. Use the space bar to pause and unpause a slideshow.
</p>
<p>
Double-click on a window to minimize it.
</p>
<p>
When you're in another app you can make an always-on-top slideshow window transparent by moving the mouse over it.
</p> 
<p>
Picture Window will remember the slideshows you have open and restore them when you quit and restart the app.
