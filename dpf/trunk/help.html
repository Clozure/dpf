Digital Photo Frame lets you keep slideshows of your favorite photos
visible on your screen all the time.
<p>
To create a new slideshow window, choose "New Slideshow from Folder..."
or "New Slideshow from iPhoto Album" from the file menu.
<p>
By default DPF windows always stay on top, even when you're using
another application. You can see what's underneath them by moving
your mouse over the DPF window.
<p>
You can change the settings of the current slideshow by using the View
menu. You can control the settings used for new slideshows through
"Preferences..." on the Digital Photo Frame menu.
<p>
You can minimize a DPF window by double-clicking on it. You can move
it by clicking and dragging in the window's title bar or in the
window's content area. DPF windows can be resized by clicking and
dragging from any side or corner.
<p>
DPF will remember the slideshows you have open and restore them when
you quit and restart the app.
